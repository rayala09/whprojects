      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>  Hello everyone, my name is Raymundo Ayala but I usually go by as just Ray. I grew up in Cantua Creek, a small town near Interstate 5. I come from a family of five with two older brothers leaving me as the youngest one. Living out in a Ranch in the middle of nowhere has its pros and cons. Personally, I love living in ranch as it is peaceful and quite with enjoyable fresh smells of crops. For example, the sounds of sirens and trains are no where to be heard, so afternoons are very peaceful and consist of usually hanging out under the shade. Most of my free time I spend it outdoors playing sports and riding motorcycles. The badside of living in a ranch is that there are literally no stores around you. Therefore, growing up I rarely went out to the theatre or mall. Which from my perspective it has made it much more enjoyable today. It is also the reason why as of today I've enjoyed traveling places much more. I have now traveled to quite a few places and attended some very exciting events. Here in my <a href="/gallery.html">Gallery</a>  you can see some of these places I've traveled and some other hobbies I have.<br>

      I am currently attending West Hills College Lemoore and pursuing a major in Computer Science. I plan on transferring to San Diego State or CSU Bakersfield upon finishing my GED.  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JV4c4HCAVe8&t=3s">Highlight Video</a> </p>
